# swift-sandbox


Repository containing various Swift examples and iOS applications. 

### Projects

As of this moment, the following applications can be found on this repository:

* [Cat Years](https://github.com/DrkSephy/swift-sandbox/tree/master/Cat%20Years/catYears): A single-view iOS application which allows the user to input the age of their cat, and will return the age in cat years.
* [How Many Fingers?](https://github.com/DrkSephy/swift-sandbox/tree/master/How%20Many%20Fingers): A single-view iOS application which allows the user to enter a guess of how many fingers are being held up, push a button and check if their guess was correct.
* [Primality Testing](https://github.com/DrkSephy/swift-sandbox/tree/master/Primality): A single-view iOS application which allows the user to enter an integer, press a button and it will return whether or not the number if prime. 
* [Stopwatch](https://github.com/DrkSephy/swift-sandbox/tree/master/Stopwatch): A single-view iOS application which acts as a stopwatch which ticks every second. The user can pause, resume and reset the stopwatch.
* [Times Tables](https://github.com/DrkSephy/swift-sandbox/tree/master/Times%20Tables): A single-view iOS application which displays a times table for numbers 1-20 using a slider to control the value. 
* [To Do List](https://github.com/DrkSephy/swift-sandbox/tree/master/To%20Do%20List): A tabbed iOS application which allows the user to input a list item on the second tab, and enter it using a button. The first tab displays the items, which can be deleted by swiping left. This application also has the ability to save entries, and will persist the items when the application is turned off and resumed.
* [What's the Weather?](https://github.com/DrkSephy/swift-sandbox/tree/master/Weather): An iOS application which grabs the weather forecast from `weather-forecast.com` and displays the weather to the user. 

### Feature Tests

Before developing an application, there are test demonstrations which help explore a new feature using Swift + the iOS development SDK on XCode. The list of demo projects are listed below:

* [Permanent Storage](https://github.com/DrkSephy/swift-sandbox/tree/master/Permanent%20Storage): A test application which demonstrates and explores how to store data whenever the application is shut down and resume. 
* [Navigation](https://github.com/DrkSephy/swift-sandbox/tree/master/Navigation): A test application for working with navigating through an application. 
* [Playgrounds](https://github.com/DrkSephy/swift-sandbox/tree/master/Playground/playgrounds): A set of Swift playgrounds for experimenting with the Swift programming constructs, such as loops, control statements, functions, etc. Playgrounds are great for writing functionality before porting it over to an iOS application - constantly reloading the application to test a change is time-consuming and not terribly efficient.
* [Table Views](https://github.com/DrkSephy/swift-sandbox/tree/master/Table%20Views): A sample application for learning to use Table Views and Prototype cells, as well as the code needed to display and edit content on a table. 
* [Animations](https://github.com/DrkSephy/swift-sandbox/tree/master/Animations): A sample application to explore iOS animations. 

### Notes

Throughout the course of development, I will try to keep my developer notes up to date. These notes will contain things that I've learned while working on these applications, as well as for my own personal reference. You may find the notes [here](https://github.com/DrkSephy/swift-sandbox/tree/master/Notes).
